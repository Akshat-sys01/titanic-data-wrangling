# Titanic Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on **cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset** using Python and Pandas.  
The goal is to transform the raw dataset into a structured and analysis-ready form by handling missing values, fixing inconsistencies, and preparing the data for further use in analysis or machine learning tasks.

---

## 📌 Features
- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset.
- Handled missing values (e.g., `age`, `embarked`, `embark_town`).
- Converted categorical features into appropriate data types.
- Filled missing values using mode/mean where applicable.
- Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns.
- Exported the cleaned dataset to a CSV file.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
